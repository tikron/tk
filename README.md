## Synopsis

This repository contains the source code for my presentation page on the web. It contains two projects. One with the Java web application and one with the static content.

## Technology

Essentially it is only a simple web application with Java Server Pages. The design of the pages is realized with Bootstrap. A bit of Javascript and CSS are also included. The application runs on a Linux virtual root server with Apache HTTP Server and Tomcat Servlet Container.

## Motivation

As a professional web developer I would like to present myself on the web. On my website you get an overview of my knowledge and skills. If you need support for your projects or your online business, we should get in touch.

## Installation
